These were all printed solid.

I printed Base, Chainholder, and Arm 2 in ABS and the Hinge components and Arm 1 in PC.

The Chain Holder has location holes for pins to secure the chain. They'll need to be drilled to the proper diameter for your pin... I used a nails but, I'm sure Cotter Pins, Dowel Pins, Spring Pins would be better.
